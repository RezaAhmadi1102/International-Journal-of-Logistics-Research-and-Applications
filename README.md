## Machine Learning-Based Model for Multi-Trip Hybrid Truck-Drone Delivery Systems Considering Uncertainty
- Abstract. The integration of drones with trucks enhances delivery efficiency and cost-effectiveness in logistics operations. This study proposes a coordinated truck-drone delivery system with multi-trip capability under uncertainty. The system follows a one-to-one pairing, ensuring each drone returns to its launching truck. A multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming model is developed to minimize both the number of trucks and total delivery time. The optimization problem is solved sequentially, prioritizing truck minimization before optimizing time. To handle uncertainty, we employ support vector clustering with a piecewise linear kernel, enhancing solution robustness. Computational experiments confirm that the approach reduces over-conservatism and robustness costs while improving the objective function as the percentage of outliers increases. Furthermore, results show that removing drones increases truck usage and total time by 23.49%, underscoring the strategic advantages of drone integration in logistics and supply chain efficiency.
